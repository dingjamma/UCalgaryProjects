University of Calgary MDSA Projects
Overview
This repository showcases a collection of projects completed during my Master of Data Science and Analytics (MDSA) program at the University of Calgary. These projects reflect the practical application of data science concepts, including data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and big data processing.

Each project includes the code, datasets (where permissible), and a detailed explanation of the approach and findings.
