## Projects

### 1. **Analyzing and Visualizing Flight Delays Dataset for year 2019(before covid)**
   - **Course**: DATA 601 - Working with Data & Visualization
   - **Objective**: Examine flight delay data from 2019 to identify temporal patterns, airline performance, geographic delay trends, and factors contributing to delays. This analysis aims to enhance   operational efficiency and inform better decision-making in the aviation industry.
   - **Technologies**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   - **Skills**: Data Cleaning, Descriptive Analysis, Data Visualization, Pattern Recognition
   - **Summary**: The project explores how delays vary by time of day, day of the week, and season, compares delay patterns among airlines, analyzes airports/routes prone to delays, and investigates factors   such as airtime and distance. The insights are communicated through clear visualizations to support stakeholders in improving punctuality and customer satisfaction.

### 2. **Analyzing and Predicting Flight Distance & Airtime in 2019**
   - **Course**: DATA 602 - Statistical Data Analysis
   - **Objective**: Investigate the statistical relationship between flight distance and airtime to inform operational decisions, including fuel estimation and entertainment preparation for passengers.
   - **Technologies**: R (Descriptive and Inferential Statistics, Linear Modeling)
   - **Skills**: Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Regression Modeling, Prediction
   - **Summary**: This project established a strong linear relationship between flight distance and airtime, demonstrating that for every additional mile traveled, airtime increases by approximately 7 seconds. The findings offer actionable insights for airline cost management and strategic planning.
